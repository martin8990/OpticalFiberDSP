#  Optical Fiber Frequency domain blockwize mimo
This library contains a Python implementation of a frequency domain blockwize mimo as described in [1].

## Features
Internal phase recovery according to the blind phase search algorithm [4]
An optinal widely linear mode to compensate for IQ-skew [2]
Support for oversampled and symbol spaced systems
Autodetects Qam constellation.
Any number of modes can be used.
Interactive visualizations.
Firstly this example usage of the equalizer, I will show how to Mimo can be configured using several settings classes in order to work optimally for different captures.

## Examples
Examples are available in the main directory.
